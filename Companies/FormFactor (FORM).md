## What They Do

### Product 101 and Where They Fit into the AI Stack
![[Images/form-cards.jpg|300]]

- FormFactor is the largest global player in probe cards. While they compete with Technoprobe in logic, they are the dominant leader in **memory testing** (DRAM/Flash) and maintain a diversified portfolio across the semi ecosystem.
- The key distinction is logic vs. memory:
  - Logic (Technoprobe's turf): complex, high speed, high heat. Checking calculations. CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators.
  - Memory (FormFactor's turf): volume, repetition, parallelism. Memory chips are commodities—you want to test 500 at a time, not one.
- FormFactor builds massive MEMS probe cards that touch and test hundreds of memory chips simultaneously. This is a different engineering problem than Technoprobe's high-pin-count logic cards.
- They offer a broader product set vs. Technoprobe's depth.

### Alignment with Overall Thesis
- HBM is the tailwind. High Bandwidth Memory stacks DRAM vertically to feed AI GPUs. It's harder to test than standard memory, requires Known Good Die testing (can't stack 8 layers if the bottom one is broken), and volume is ramping as SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung feed Nvidia's demand.
- Important distinction from Camtek: Camtek uses cameras to find visible errors (bumps look straight). FormFactor uses probes to find functional errors (can the memory actually store and retrieve data). You need both.
### Business Model, Customers
- $75k-$150k per card. Consumable model—cards are "ink cartridges" for testing. Recurring based on touchdowns (volume).
- Core customers are memory IDMs (SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung). Also serves logic, but Technoprobe has been gaining share in high-end logic.
- More diversified than Technoprobe (memory, logic, R&D systems), which provides stability but also more exposure to memory cyclicality.

### Comments on Team
- Founded in 1993; founder no longer in company.
- Standard US corporate structure, unlike Technoprobe's family dynasty. Led by Mike Slessor (CEO)—focused on M&A, supply chain optimization, steady diversified growth.

### Early View of Moat Hypothesis
- Memory testing dominance. Engineering for testing 500 chips simultaneously is non-trivial.
- Breadth of portfolio makes them a one-stop shop for fabs that don't want multiple vendors.
- Scale and supply chain leverage—larger than Technoprobe.

## Why They're Interesting, and Why Now
- HBM is the near-term catalyst. Memory makers are scrambling to ramp production, every stack needs Known Good Die testing, and FormFactor is the incumbent.
- We have to believe HBM shortage persists and FormFactor defends its position as testing complexity increases.
- Diversification provides downside protection vs. pure logic plays, but also means more memory cycle exposure.

## Key Risks
- Memory cyclicality. When memory prices crash, capex freezes. FormFactor is more exposed than Technoprobe.
- Market share loss in logic—Technoprobe has been gaining in high-end logic. FormFactor needs to defend.
- Being the "supermarket" can mean lower margins and less pricing power than a specialist.

## Gaps in Understanding / Key Questions
- How much of the HBM tailwind is priced in? Is memory dominance durable as HBM complexity increases?
- What's the real market share trajectory in logic vs. Technoprobe? Ceding high-end or defending?
- How differentiated is HBM probe card engineering vs. standard DRAM?
