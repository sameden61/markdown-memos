# Lam Research (LRCX)

> [!warning] Too far outside sweet spot
> However, understanding Lam is essential for understanding the 3D NAND and eSSD upgrade cycle that benefits companies like Pure Storage and Micron. Lam's etch and deposition tools are what make 200+ layer memory stacks possible. 

**Category:** Equipment (Etch & Deposition)
**Est. Price Per Unit:** $3M - $5M per tool (~$5M+ per chamber)

## What They Do

### Product 101 and Where They Fit into the AI Stack
![[Images/lrcx-machine.jpg|300]]

- Lam is the leader in **semiconductor etch equipment** (~45% global share) and #2 in deposition (behind Applied Materials).
- Etch explained: after material is deposited on a wafer, etch tools selectively remove material to create 3D structures. Deposition is "painting," etch is "sculpting."
- Why this matters for AI: unlike 2D NAND (lithography-enabled), **3D NAND is deposition and etch enabled**. Building 200+ layer memory towers requires etching vertical channels at aspect ratios exceeding 100:1. This is Lam's specialty.
- Key products:
  - Cryo 3.0: cryogenic etch technology targeting 1,000-layer 3D NAND. Uses extreme cold for cleaner vertical etches.
  - Flex and Vantex: high aspect ratio etch systems for memory hole etching
  - Altus Halo: molybdenum ALD system, selected for three consecutive nodes at a leading customer for 500+ layer NAND
- The challenge: etching a trillion holes per wafer at >100:1 aspect ratios without bowing, twisting, or incomplete etching. This is edge-of-physics engineering.

### Alignment with Overall Thesis
- AI is driving demand for high-capacity storage. Data centers need enterprise SSDs with higher layer counts. ~2/3 of NAND capacity remains at older nodes—significant upgrade potential.
- The industry is targeting 1,000-layer 3D NAND by ~2030. Every layer transition requires more etch and deposition steps. Lam scales with complexity.
- Also benefits from HBM production (etch/deposition for memory stacking), though smaller than NAND exposure.
- Shipped $1B+ each for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging in 2024; 2025 combined expected to exceed $3B.

### Business Model, Customers
- ~$5M+ per machine per chamber.
- Node transition purchasing dynamic—bought when fabs move to new nodes or build capacity. Also scales with material transitions (tungsten to molybdenum).
- Higher memory exposure (NAND, DRAM) than Applied Materials, which is more logic-balanced. More cyclicality, but more leverage to 3D NAND upgrades.
- Customers: memory IDMs (Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron) and leading logic fabs (TSMC, Intel).

### Comments on Team
- Founder David Lam started the company in 1980 and left in early 1990s.
- Professional management. CEO Tim Archer joined in 2012, became CEO in 2018.
- Engineering-driven culture focused on customer collaboration and process integration.

### Early View of Moat Hypothesis
- High aspect ratio etch leadership. Etching at 100:1 is edge-of-physics. Lam has a decade+ head start in cryogenic etch.
- Process integration—Lam co-develops processes with memory makers. Creates lock-in.
- Winning material transitions (tungsten to molybdenum). Altus Halo selected for three consecutive nodes at a leading customer.

## Why They're Interesting, and Why Now
- AI data explosion drives demand for higher-capacity storage. Enterprise SSDs with 200+ layer 3D NAND are the near-term solution. Lam's tools are the bottleneck enablers.
- NAND spending is recovering in 2025—driven by technology upgrades rather than capacity expansion. Healthier growth dynamics.
- Our view: Lam is a great company with direct AI exposure through 3D NAND and HBM. But it's a $100B+ incumbent with memory cyclicality risk. We prefer expressing the storage complexity theme through Pure Storage, which benefits from NAND advances without cyclical equipment exposure.

## Key Risks
- Memory cyclicality. NAND is boom/bust. When prices crash, capex freezes. Lam is more exposed than Applied Materials.
- China concentration—significant revenue at risk from export restrictions.
- Applied Materials has broader scale and is pushing into etch. Tokyo Electron competitive in Asia.

## Gaps in Understanding / Key Questions
- How much of NAND recovery is priced in? Duration of upgrade cycle?
- Is the HAR etch moat durable as competitors invest? Gap vs. Tokyo Electron?
- What portion of revenue is truly AI-driven vs. general NAND/DRAM capacity?

## Patent Analysis

### 3D NAND Patent Timeline
AMAT leads in 3D NAND patents by volume. Lam has fewer filings but consistent presence. Note: patent volume doesn't always correlate with market position—Lam's etch leadership may be more about process know-how than patent count.

### Deposition & Etch: AMAT vs LRCX
AMAT dominates EUV and 3D NAND patent filings. Lam's citation rate has historically been competitive with AMAT, suggesting quality over quantity.
