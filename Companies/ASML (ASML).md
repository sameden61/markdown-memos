# ASML (ASML)

> [!warning] Too far outside sweet spot
> ASML is a $300B+ Dutch mega-cap with no founder involvement. However, understanding ASML is essential because they are the ultimate bottleneck in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Every AI chip at 7nm or below requires ASML's EUV machines. No ASML, no advanced chips.

**Category:** Equipment (Lithography)
**Est. Price Per Unit:** $150M - $380M+ per EUV system

## What They Do

### Product 101 and Where They Fit into the AI Stack

- ASML is the **monopoly provider of EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography machines**. These are the "printers" that pattern transistors onto silicon wafers at the most advanced nodes (7nm, 5nm, 3nm, 2nm).
- Lithography is the most critical step in chipmaking. A chip may go through 80+ lithography steps. At advanced nodes, EUV is required—there is no alternative.
- **How EUV works:** A high-powered laser hits molten tin droplets 50,000 times per second, creating plasma hotter than the sun's surface. This plasma emits extreme ultraviolet light (13.5nm wavelength) which bounces off mirrors and patterns the wafer through a reticle. The engineering is absurd.
- **Machine tiers:**
  - DUV (Deep Ultraviolet): Older technology, still used for less critical layers. ~$100M per system.
  - EUV: Required for leading edge. ~$150-200M per system.
  - High-NA EUV: Next generation for 2nm and below. ~$350-380M per system. Intel took first delivery in 2024.
- **Throughput:** A single EUV machine can process ~150 wafers per hour. Fabs need dozens of these machines.

### Alignment with Overall Thesis
- Every AI chip (H100, Blackwell, MI300, TPU) requires EUV lithography. ASML is the picks-and-shovels play on all advanced silicon.
- As AI demand drives more fab capacity (TSMC Arizona, Intel Ohio, Samsung Texas), ASML order books grow.
- The shift to 2nm and below requires High-NA EUV, which costs nearly 2x more per system—ASP expansion.

### Business Model, Customers
- ~$150-380M per system depending on type. Lead times are 18-24+ months.
- **Customers:** TSMC (~30-40% of revenue), Samsung, Intel, and memory IDMs. Only ~3-4 customers can afford leading-edge EUV.
- **Recurring revenue:** ~30% from services, upgrades, and spare parts on installed base of 200+ EUV systems.
- **Capacity constrained:** ASML produces ~50-60 EUV systems per year. Demand exceeds supply.
- Backlog was €36B as of late 2024—roughly 1.5 years of revenue visibility.

### Comments on Team
- Founded in 1984 as a Philips/ASM International joint venture.
- Not founder-led. Current CEO is Christophe Fouquet (since 2024), previously Peter Wennink (2013-2024).
- Dutch company headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands.
- Highly technical engineering culture. Many key components made by partners (Zeiss for optics, Trumpf for lasers).

### Early View of Moat Hypothesis
- **Monopoly:** There is no second source for EUV. Canon and Nikon failed to develop competitive EUV technology. This took ASML 20+ years and tens of billions of R&D.
- **Ecosystem lock-in:** Zeiss (optics) and Trumpf (lasers) are exclusive partners. The supply chain is vertically integrated around ASML.
- **Cumulative learning:** Each generation builds on the last. High-NA EUV is only possible because of learnings from prior EUV. Catch-up is nearly impossible.
- **Geopolitical protection:** Dutch export controls (aligned with US) prevent sales of advanced EUV to China, protecting the moat from being replicated.

## Why They're Interesting, and Why Now
- ASML is interesting as the ultimate "toll road" on advanced semiconductors. We have to believe AI chip demand continues—if it does, ASML benefits regardless of who wins (Nvidia, AMD, Intel, custom ASICs).
- High-NA EUV is ramping, which means higher ASPs and potentially higher margins.
- However, the stock is expensive and already prices in continued dominance. The thesis is more "understand the ecosystem" than "buy ASML for alpha."

## Key Risks
- **Cyclicality:** Semiconductor capex is cyclical. When TSMC/Intel cut spending, ASML orders slow.
- **China exposure:** Export restrictions limit the China TAM. If restrictions tighten further or China develops domestic alternatives (unlikely near-term), it's a headwind.
- **Customer concentration:** 3-4 customers represent nearly all revenue. If one major customer delays orders, it's material.
- **Valuation:** Trading at premium multiples. Any miss on growth expectations will hurt.

## Gaps in Understanding / Key Questions
- How much of High-NA EUV demand is already in backlog vs. upside?
- Can China develop domestic EUV in 10 years? 20 years? What's the realistic timeline?
- How does ASML's capacity expansion plan (doubling capacity by 2025-2026) affect pricing power?
