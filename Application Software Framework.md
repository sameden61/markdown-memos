# Application Software Framework: Investing in the AI Era

The AI era creates a fundamental repricing of what makes application software valuable. This document frames how to think about application layer investing when intelligence becomes abundant and cheap.

---

## The Central Tension: Commoditization vs. Value Expansion

The bull and bear cases for application software in the AI era are both compelling:

**Bear Case (Commoditization):**
- Features become trivially easy to build ("just prompt it")
- Foundation model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) capture most value
- Apps become "thin wrappers" with no defensibility
- Open-source equivalents emerge for everything
- Switching costs collapse as AI can migrate data/workflows

**Bull Case (Value Expansion):**
- AI dramatically expands what software can do (new TAMs)
- Proprietary data + AI creates compounding moats
- Workflow orchestration and trust become more valuable
- Outcome-based pricing captures more customer value
- Vertical expertise is hard to replicate even with AI

**Our job:** Identify which applications are on which side of this tension, and why.

## What Enterprises Value: Changed vs. Unchanged

Before diving into frameworks, it's worth grounding in what enterprise buyers actually care about—and what AI changes (or doesn't).

### What Doesn't Change (Enduring Enterprise Priorities)

These priorities existed before AI and will persist after. Vendors who forget them will lose.

| Priority | Why It Endures |
|----------|----------------|
| **Reliability / Uptime** | Downtime costs money. AI doesn't change this—may increase stakes. |
| **Security & Compliance** | Regulatory requirements don't disappear. AI adds new vectors (data leakage, model risk). |
| **Vendor Stability** | Enterprises don't want to bet on vendors that might disappear. |
| **Accountability** | Someone to call when things break. Someone to sue if needed. |
| **Integration with Existing Systems** | Enterprises have tech debt. New tools must fit the stack. |
| **Total Cost of Ownership** | CFOs still run the numbers. AI ≠ blank check. |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Enterprises are risk-averse by nature. AI increases perceived risk in some areas. |
| **Support & Customer Success** | Humans still want to talk to humans when stakes are high. |

**Implication for incumbents:** These are incumbent advantages. Startups often underestimate how much enterprises value "boring" things like support, compliance, and stability.

### What Changes (New Enterprise Priorities)

| Old Priority | New Priority | Implication |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Time-to-value: months** | **Time-to-value: days/hours** | AI can self-configure. Enterprises expect faster ROI. Long implementations become competitive disadvantage. |
| **Feature checklist** | **Outcome delivery** | "Does it have X feature?" → "Does it achieve Y outcome?" Features commoditize; results differentiate. |
| **Training & change management** | **Intuitive AI interfaces** | If users need weeks of training, the AI isn't good enough. Natural language reduces learning curves. |
| **Customization via services** | **Customization via AI** | Professional services for configuration → AI that adapts to context. Services revenue may compress. |
| **Best-of-breed vs. suite debate** | **AI as integration layer** | AI may reduce switching costs and enable best-of-breed by handling integration. Or AI may favor suites with unified data. Unclear. |
| **"Good enough" bar** | **"Good enough" rises** | AI makes everything better. Mediocre products can't hide. But also: everything becomes "good enough" faster. |
| **Human expertise as differentiator** | **AI expertise as differentiator** | "Our consultants are the best" → "Our AI is the best." Human expertise becomes table stakes; AI capability becomes the wedge. |

**Implication for incumbents:** Incumbents built for the old priorities (long implementations, training ecosystems, services revenue) may find these become liabilities.

## Success Characteristics: Pre-AI, Post-AI, and Enduring

This is the critical framework for evaluating whether an incumbent's advantages persist.

### Pre-AI Success Factors (May Become Liabilities)

These characteristics drove success in the traditional SaaS era but may weaken or reverse in the AI era.

| Characteristic | Why It Worked Pre-AI | Why It May Hurt Post-AI |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Large professional services revenue** | Customization = stickiness. Services margin was gravy. | AI replaces customization. Services become cost center, not profit center. Customers expect self-serve. |
| **Complex feature breadth** | More features = higher switching costs. Justified premium pricing. | AI commoditizes features. Complexity becomes bloat. Simpler AI-native competitors win. |
| **Training & certification ecosystem** | Created lock-in. Partners invested in your platform. | AI reduces need for training. Certification value erodes. Partner ecosystem may become stranded asset. |
| **Implementation partner network** | Extended sales reach. Handled complexity you couldn't. | AI self-implements. Partners become unnecessary middlemen. Channel conflict emerges. |
| **"Land with services, expand with software"** | Effective wedge into enterprises. Built relationships. | Services become loss leader with no software expansion. Margins compress. |
| **Per-seat pricing at scale** | Predictable, scalable revenue. Easy to sell. | AI does work of multiple humans. Per-seat becomes misaligned with value delivered. Customers demand outcome pricing. |
| **Moat via integration complexity** | Hard to rip out = sticky. | AI handles integrations. Switching costs decline. Complexity becomes liability. |

**Red flag for incumbents:** If >20% of revenue is professional services, or if the sales motion depends heavily on implementation partners, the model may be structurally challenged.

### Post-AI Success Factors (New Requirements)

These characteristics matter in the AI era but didn't exist or weren't differentiators before.

| Characteristic | Why It Matters Post-AI | Who Has It |
|----------------|------------------------|------------|
| **AI-native architecture** | Bolted-on AI can't compete with AI-first design. Data flows, latency, and UX all differ. | Startups (by default). Few incumbents. |
| **Proprietary training data** | Fine-tuned models on unique data outperform generic models. | Incumbents with years of customer data (if they can use it). |
| **Real-time learning loops** | AI that improves from usage compounds advantage. | Requires architecture investment. Most don't have this yet. |
| **Outcome measurement capability** | Can't charge for outcomes if you can't prove them. | Analytics-forward companies. Requires instrumentation. |
| **Agentic execution capability** | Inform → Execute is the value migration. Software that acts, not just advises. | New capability for everyone. Startups may move faster. |
| **Unstructured data handling** | Enterprise data is 80%+ unstructured. AI unlocks it. | Vendors who invested in document/audio/video processing. |
| **Model ops / AI governance** | Enterprises need to audit, explain, and control AI. | Emerging requirement. Few have mature solutions. |
| **Consumption-based infrastructure** | AI workloads are variable. Fixed costs don't work. | Cloud-native vendors. Legacy on-prem struggles. |

**Green flag for startups:** AI-native architecture is a genuine advantage. Incumbents can't easily retrofit.

**Green flag for incumbents:** Proprietary training data is a genuine advantage. Startups can't easily acquire 10 years of enterprise workflow data.

### Enduring Success Factors (Both Pre-AI and Post-AI)

These characteristics mattered before AI and will continue to matter. They're the true durable advantages.

| Characteristic | Why It Endures |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Customer trust / brand reputation** | Trust takes years to build. AI increases stakes (data sensitivity, decision-making). Trusted vendors win. |
| **Data gravity / system of record position** | Data is heavy. Migration is painful. AI doesn't change this—may increase it (more data = better AI). |
| **Distribution / GTM motion** | Enterprise sales relationships don't commoditize. Feet on the street still matter. |
| **Regulatory & compliance expertise** | AI adds new compliance requirements (model risk, explainability). Expertise compounds. |
| **Network effects** | More users = more data = better AI = more users. The flywheel accelerates. |
| **Vertical domain expertise** | Deep industry knowledge can't be prompt-engineered. Encoded in product, not just model. |
| **Enterprise relationship density** | Multi-threaded relationships across the org survive AI transitions. |
| **Capital / balance sheet strength** | AI requires investment. Well-capitalized vendors can afford the transition. |

**The key question for incumbents:** Do they have enduring advantages AND can they shed pre-AI liabilities? The combination matters.

## The Incumbent Scorecard: Will They Win or Lose?

Putting it together: evaluate incumbents on this scorecard.

```

## Framework 1: The Defensibility Stack

Not all moats are created equal in the AI era. Some traditional moats weaken; others strengthen.

```
MOAT DURABILITY IN AI ERA

        WEAKENING                          STRENGTHENING
        ─────────                          ─────────────

        Feature complexity                 Proprietary data
        (AI can replicate)                 (AI makes it more valuable)

        UI/UX polish                       Workflow embedding
        (AI can generate)                  (Habits + integrations)

        Integrations                       Trust & compliance
        (APIs are easy)                    (Regulated industries)

        Brand awareness                    Network effects
        (Attention is fragmented)          (More users = better AI)

        First-mover advantage              Distribution/GTM
        (Fast followers enabled)           (Enterprise relationships)
```

**Investment implication:** Weight companies with moats on the right side. A beautiful UI with complex features is less defensible than ugly software embedded in a regulated workflow with proprietary data.

---

## Framework 2: The Data Flywheel Matrix

AI changes the value of data. The question is: does the company's data get *more* valuable with AI, or does AI make their data *less* differentiated?

```
                        DATA UNIQUENESS

              Commodity                     Proprietary

    E    │                         │                         │
    R    │   STRUCTURAL            │   COMPOUNDING           │

    E    │   Incumbents with       │   Proprietary data +    │
         │   legacy data that      │   AI = exponential      │
    H    │   AI can now access     │   value creation        │
    I    │   directly              │                         │
    G    │                         │   Examples: Vertical    │
    H    │   Example: Research     │   SaaS with customer    │
         │   databases, content    │   workflow data,        │
         │   aggregators           │   systems of record     │
         └─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

**The "Compounding Advantage" quadrant:**
- Unique data generated through customer usage
- AI makes that data more actionable (predictions, automation)
- Better AI → more customers → more data → better AI
- Example: A vertical CRM that has 10 years of sales conversations can train models on "what wins deals" that no one else can replicate

## Framework 3: Workflow Position—Where Do You Sit?

AI changes *what* software does, but *where* it sits in the workflow determines defensibility.

```
WORKFLOW POSITION SPECTRUM

SYSTEM OF RECORD          SYSTEM OF ENGAGEMENT         SYSTEM OF ACTION
(Where data lives)        (Where work happens)         (Where decisions execute)
       │                          │                            │
       ▼                          ▼                            ▼
┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐

│  Database   │    ──►    │  Workspace  │    ──►     │   Agent     │
│  of record  │           │  + copilot  │            │   executor  │
│             │           │             │            │             │
└─────────────┘           └─────────────┘            └─────────────┘

Traditional SaaS          Current AI apps            Future AI apps
moat: switching           moat: habit +              moat: trust +
costs, data gravity       integration                outcomes

Risk: AI queries          Risk: AI does the          Risk: Platform
the data directly         work, app becomes          providers do this
                          pass-through               themselves
```

**Key insight:** Value is migrating rightward. Systems of record are necessary but insufficient. The new high ground is "System of Action"—software that doesn't just inform decisions but executes them.

**But:** Systems of Action require trust. Trust requires track record, compliance, and liability frameworks. This is why **regulated verticals** (healthcare, finance, legal) may see more durable AI application businesses—trust barriers are higher.

---

## Framework 4: The Copilot → Autopilot Spectrum

AI applications exist on a spectrum from "augments human work" to "replaces human work." Different positions have different economics and risks.

```
COPILOT                                                    AUTOPILOT
(Human in the loop)                                    (Human out of the loop)
    │                                                          │
    ▼                                                          ▼
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│        │        │        │        │        │        │        │
│ Smart  │ Draft  │ Review │ Execute│ Monitor│ Escalate│ Fully │
│ search │ assist │ assist │ w/     │ + alert│ only   │ auto  │
│        │        │        │ confirm│        │        │        │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

Lower value         ◄─────────────────────►         Higher value
capture but                                          capture but
safer, faster                                        harder, slower
adoption                                             adoption

Seat-based          ◄─────────────────────►         Outcome-based
pricing                                              pricing
```

**The pricing implication is critical:**
- Copilot = "We help your employees do more" = seat-based pricing (limited upside)
- Autopilot = "We do the work" = outcome-based or usage-based pricing (captures more value)

**The adoption implication:**
- Copilots sell into existing budget (productivity tools)
- Autopilots compete with headcount (requires executive buy-in, longer sales cycles)

**Investment view:** Copilots are easier to build and sell but have compressed margins and commoditization risk. Autopilots are harder but capture more value if they work.

## Framework 5: Vertical vs. Horizontal

A classic framework, but AI changes the calculus.

```
                        MARKET SIZE

              Narrow TAM                    Large TAM

    W    └─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

**AI-era insight:** Horizontal + low differentiation is the danger zone. This is where "ChatGPT can do that" applies.

**The vertical opportunity:** Deep verticals have several advantages in AI:
1. **Domain-specific training data** that foundation models lack
2. **Regulatory complexity** that creates trust barriers
3. **Workflow specificity** that generic AI can't address
4. **Integration requirements** with industry-specific systems
5. **Professional liability** concerns that favor established vendors

---

## Framework 6: Business Model Evolution

AI enables (and may require) new business models. The shift from seat-based to outcome-based is fundamental.

```
TRADITIONAL                              AI-NATIVE
───────────                              ─────────

Seat-based pricing          ──►          Outcome-based pricing
($X per user per month)                  ($X per result delivered)

Feature differentiation     ──►          Capability differentiation
(We have feature Y)                      (We achieve outcome Z)

Time-to-value: weeks        ──►          Time-to-value: minutes
(Implementation, training)               (AI handles setup)

Professional services       ──►          Self-serve AI onboarding
(Human customization)                    (AI configures itself)

Annual contracts            ──►          Usage-based billing
(Predictable, locked in)                 (Variable, value-aligned)

NRR via upsell              ──►          NRR via consumption growth
(More seats, more modules)               (More AI usage = more value)
```

**Investment implication:** Look for companies that can credibly shift to outcome-based pricing. This requires:
1. Measurable outcomes (ROI must be provable)
2. Confidence in AI reliability (can't charge for outcomes if AI fails)
3. Customer sophistication (willingness to pay for outcomes vs. inputs)

---

## Framework 7: The Incumbent vs. Insurgent Matrix

AI creates both opportunities for startups and weapons for incumbents.

```

**The uncomfortable truth:** In many markets, AI may simply reinforce incumbent advantages. Salesforce with AI is more defensible than Salesforce without AI. The data and distribution moats compound.

**Where insurgents win:**
1. Greenfield markets AI creates (didn't exist before)
2. Markets where incumbents are structurally slow (regulated, tech debt)
3. "Wedge" strategies that start narrow and expand
4. Consumerization of enterprise (bottoms-up adoption)

## Key Questions for Any Application Software Investment

### On Defensibility:
1. What data does this company have that no one else has?
2. Does AI make that data more or less valuable?
3. Where does this sit in the workflow—record, engagement, or action?
4. Can a foundation model provider replicate this with a plugin?

### On Business Model:
5. Is pricing seat-based or outcome-based? Can it shift?
6. What's the marginal cost of serving an additional customer with AI?
7. Does AI increase or decrease gross margins?
8. Is NRR driven by seat expansion or consumption growth?

### On Competition:
9. Can the incumbent add AI faster than the startup can add distribution?
10. Is the startup AI-native or AI-augmented? (Architecture matters)
11. What's the switching cost—is it data, workflow, or just habit?
12. Who owns the customer relationship—the app or the platform?

### On Timing:
13. Is AI capability sufficient today, or is this a "wait for GPT-6" bet?
14. Is customer willingness to adopt ahead of or behind the technology?
15. What's the regulatory trajectory—enabling or constraining?

## Thesis Summary: Where to Play

**Most attractive:**
- Vertical applications with proprietary workflow data in regulated industries
- System of Action plays where trust barriers are high
- Outcome-based pricing models that align incentives
- AI-native architectures that compound data advantages

**Most risky:**
- Horizontal productivity tools competing with foundation model providers
- "Thin wrapper" applications with no data moat
- Seat-based pricing in commoditizing categories
- AI-augmented incumbents in categories where distribution wins

**The meta-question:** Does AI expand this company's moat or erode it? If AI makes their unique asset (data, workflow, expertise) more valuable, invest. If AI makes their product easier to replicate, avoid.
